Description: Declarative architecture constraints
 This is a meta package that provide declarative architecture
 constraints like "architecture-is-64-bit" or
 "architecture-is-little-endian" for cases where architecture
 wildcard support in the Architecture field is insufficient.
 .
 Example usage: "Build-Depends: architecture-is-64-bit".
 .
 This package is provided solely for the purpose of being used
 in build-dependencies to simplify management of architecture
 support.
